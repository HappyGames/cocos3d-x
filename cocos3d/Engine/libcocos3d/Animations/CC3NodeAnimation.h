/** 
 * A CC3NodeAnimation manages the animation of a node.
 *
 * An instance is held in the animation property of the node itself, and the node delegates
 * to its CC3NodeAnimation when the establishAnimationFrameAt: method is invoked on the node.
 *
 * Animations define animated content in in a series of frames (often called key-frames),
 * and can be configured to interpolate the animated state between these frames if necessary,
 * ensuring smooth animation, regardless of how many, or how widely spaced, the frames of
 * actual animated content are.
 *
 * A single CC3NodeAnimation instance can be shared by multiple nodes. This is a typical
 * situation when creating many copies of a node that is animated.
 *
 * CC3NodeAnimation is an abstract class. Subclasses define concrete animation data storage.

	 * is quite common for the effective number of animated frames to be substantially higher than
	 * the number of frames of available animated content.
	 *
	 * As an extreme example, this property might indicate only two frames of animated content
	 * (a beginning and end state). If that animation played out over 10 seconds, it would interpolate
	 * several hundred "tween-frames", creating a smooth transition from the beginning to end state.
	 * More commonly, animations will specify a number of frames of content, to ensure sophisticated
	 * and realistic animation.

	 * that frame time and the next or previous frame time. This allows the animation to avoid an
	 * interpolation calculation if the difference will be unnoticable when compared to simply using
	 * the values for that specific frame.

	 * This value is specified as a fraction of a frame (between zero and one). The initial value is
	 * set at 0.1, indicating that no interpolation will be performed if the animation time is within
	 * 10% of the duration between the frame and the frame before or after it.
