/**
 * LogGLErrorTrace logs an ERROR level description of any glError that has occurred
 * since it was last called.
 *
 * LogGLErrorTrace is distinct from LogGLErrorState in that it is called during
 * every GL call, whereas LogGLErrorState is invoked only once per rendering loop.
 * This permits dual-level detection of GL errors, that can be configured as follows:
 * 
 *   - During development, enable GL_ERROR_LOGGING_ENABLED in all projects, but leave
 *     GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED disabled. This will cause the occurance of a GL error
 *     to be checked and logged once at the end of each rendering loop.
 *   - If such a GL error log is encountered, temporarily enable GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED
 *     in your project to turn on the checking and logging of GL errors on each GL call,
 *     thereby detecting and logging the precise GL call that triggered the GL error.
 *   - Once the GL error is resolved and corrected, disable GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED
 *     to remove the overhead of testing for a GL error on every GL call.
 *
 * The GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED compiler build switch requires that the GL_ERROR_LOGGING_ENABLED
 * compiler build switch is also set.
 * 
 * Like all logging macros, LogGLErrorTrace takes a format string and a variable length list of
 * arguments. The GL error code and description is also added to the logged information.
 * 
 * Use the LogGLErrorTrace() macro and the GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED compile switch to turn checking
 * and logging of GL error tracing. Be sure to set the compiler switch GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED to
 * zero when compiling for production code release, to avoid the overhead of making the GL error
 * state call. This is important to maximize the GL state machine throughput.
 *
 * If the compiler switch GL_ERROR_ASSERTION_ENABLED is set to anything other than zero, an 
 * assertion error will also be raised to halt execution at the point where the GL error 
 * occurred, otherwise, the error will be logged and execution will continue.
 *
 * When GL_ERROR_TRACING_ENABLED is switched on, you can also cause ALL GL calls to be logged,
 * regardless of whether they cause a GL error. This is done by bracketing sections of your
 * code between calls to the functions CC3StartLoggingGLCalls() and CC3StopLoggingGLCalls().
 *
 * Since logging all GL calls can be excessively voluminous, bracketing allows you to restrict
 * the logging of all GL calls to an area of code on which you wish to focus. For instance, 
 * you might call CC3StartLoggingGLCalls() at the start of a single method of interest, and
 * CC3StopLoggingGLCalls() at the end of the same method. At the other extreme, you can call
 * CC3StartLoggingGLCalls() at the start of you app to cause all GL calls generated by your
 * app to be logged. 
 *
 * See the description of the CC3StartLoggingGLCalls() and CC3StopLoggingGLCalls() functions
 * for more info on logging all GL calls.
