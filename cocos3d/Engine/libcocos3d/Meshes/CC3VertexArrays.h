/**
 * CC3VertexArray manages the content associated with an aspect of a vertex. CC3VertexArray
 * is an abstract implementation, and there are several sublcasses, each specialized to
 * manage the vertex content for a different vertex aspect (locations, normals, colors,
 * texture mapping, indices...).
 *
 * Each instance of a subclass of CC3VertexArray maintains a reference to the underlying
 * vertex content in memory, along with various parameters describing the underlying content,
 * such as its type, element size, stride, etc.
 *
 * The underlying content can be interleaved and shared by several CC3VertexArray subclasses,
 * each looking at a different aspect of the content for each vertex. In this case, the vertices
 * property of each of those vertex array instances will reference the same underlying content
 * memory, and the elementOffset property of each CC3VertexArray instance will indicate at which
 * offset in each vertex content the datum of interest to that instance is located.
 *
 * The CC3VertexArray instance also manages buffering the content to the GL engine, including
 * loading it into a server-side GL vertex buffer object (VBO) if desired. Once loaded into
 * the GL engine buffers, the underlying content can be released from the CC3VertexArray instance,
 * thereby freeing memory, by using the releaseRedundantContent method.
 *
 * The CC3DrawableVertexArray abstract subclass adds the functionality to draw the vertex
 * content to the display through the GL engine.
 *
 * When drawing the vertices to the GL engine, each subclass remembers which vertices were
 * last drawn, and only binds the vertices to the GL engine when a different set of vertices
 * of the same type are drawn. This allows the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes
 * within the CC3Scene so that nodes using the same mesh vertices are drawn together, before
 * moving on to other meshes. This strategy can minimize the number of vertex pointer
 * switches in the GL engine, which improves performance.
 *
 * Vertex arrays support the NSCopying protocol, but in normal operation, the need to create
 * copies of vertex arrays is rare.
 *
 * By default, when a mesh node is copied, it does not make a separate copy of its model.
 * Both the original and the copy make use of the same mesh instance. Similarly, when
 * a mesh is copied, it does not make separate copies of its vertex arrays. Instead,
 * both the original and the copy make use of the same vertex array instances.
 *
 * However, in some cases, such as populating a mesh from a template and then manipulating
 * the contents of each resulting mesh individually, creating copies of vertex arrays can
 * be useful.
 *
 * If you do find need to create a copy of a vertex array, you can do so by invoking the
 * copy method. However, you should take care to understand several points about copying
 * vertex arrays:
 *   - Copying a vertex array creates a full copy of the vertex content. This may consume
 *     significant memory.
 *   - The vertex content is copied for each vertex array copy. If several vertex arrays share
 *     interleaved content, multiple copies of that content will be created. This is almost
 *     never what you intend to do, and results in significant redundant content in memory.
 *     Instead, consider creating a copy of one of the vertex arrays, and then manually
 *     populating the others so that the interleaved vertex content can be shared.
 *   - If the value of the shouldReleaseRedundantContent property of the original vertex
 *     array is YES and releaseRedundantContent has been invoked, there will be no vertex
 *     content to be copied.
 *   - The new vertex array will not have a GL vertex buffer object associated with it.
 *     To buffer the vertex content of the new vertex array, invoke the createGLBuffer method
 *     on the new vertex array.
