/**
 * A CC3VertexArray that manages the drawing indices of an array of vertices.
 *
 * This class is also a type of CC3DrawableVertexArray, and as such,
 * is capable of drawing the vertices to the GL engine.
 *
 * A vertex index array is different than other vertex arrays in that instead of managing
 * actual vertex content, it manages indexes that reference the vertices of the other vertex
 * arrays. The bufferTarget property is GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, the elementSize
 * property is 1, and the elementType is either GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT or GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
 *
 * Because an index datum does not describe an aspect of a particular vertex, but rather
 * points to a vertex, index content cannot be interleaved with the vertex content. As such,
 * the content underlying a CC3VertexIndices is never interleaved and shared with the content
 * underlying the other vertex arrays in a mesh.

	 * Convenience method to populate this index array from the specified run-length

	 *
	 * Run-length encoded arrays are used to compactly store a set of variable-length
	 * sub-arrays of indexes, where the first element of each sub-array indicates the
	 * number of content elements contained in that sub-array.
	 *
	 * For example, if the first element of the array (element zero) contains the value 5,
	 * then the next 5 elements of the array contain the first 5 content elements of the first
	 * sub-array. Then the next element of the array (element 6) contains the length of the
	 * second sub-array, and so on.
	 *
	 * The total number of elements in the run-length array, including the run-length entries
	 * is specified by the rlaLen parameter.
	 *
	 * Run-length encoded arrays are of limited use as GL index arrays, because they cannot
	 * easily be copied into, and managed as a VBO in the GL engine, which is a performance
	 * hinderance. And becuase run-length encoded arrays intermix vertex indices and run
	 * lengths, it makes accessing individual vertex indices and faces unwieldy.
