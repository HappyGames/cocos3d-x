/**
 * A CC3SkinSection defines a section of the skin mesh, and contains a collection of
 * bones from the skeleton that influence the locations of the vertices in that section.
 *
 * The skin section is expressed as a range of consecutive vertices from the mesh, as
 * specified by the vertexStart and vertexCount properties. These properties define the
 * first vertex of the section and the number of vertices in the section, respectively.
 *
 * The skin section also contains a collection of the bones that influence the vertices in
 * the skin section. The bones are ordered in that collection such that the index of a bone
 * in the collection corresponds to the index held for a vertex in the vertexMatrixIndices
 * vertex array of the mesh.
 *
 * Through the CC3VertexBoneIndices vertex array in the vertexMatrixIndices property of the mesh,
 * each vertex identifies several distinct indices into the bones collection of this skin section.
 * The transform matrices from those bones are combined in a weighted fashion, and used to transform
 * the location of the vertex. Each vertex defines its own set of weights through the CC3VertexWeights
 * vertex array in the vertexWeights property of the mesh.

	 * The collection of bones from the skeleton that influence the mesh vertices that are managed
	 * and drawn by this skin section.
	 * 
	 * Each vertex holds a set of indices into this mesh, to identify the bones that contribute to
	 * the transforming of that vertex. The contribution that each bone makes is weighted by the
	 * corresponding weights held by the vertex.
	 *
	 * Any particular vertex will typically only be directly influenced by two or three bones.
	 * Under OpenGL ES 1.1, the maximum number of bones that any vertex can be directly influenced
	 * by is determined by the maximum number of available bone influences allowed by the platform.
	 * This limit can be retreived from the CC3OpenGL.sharedGL.maxNumberOfBoneInfluencesPerVertex property.
	 *
	 * Because different vertices of the skin section may be influenced by different combinations
	 * of bones, the number of bones in the collection in this property will generally be larger
	 * than the number of bones used per vertex.
	 *
	 * However, when the vertices are drawn, all of the vertices in this skin section are drawn with
	 * a single call to the GL engine. All of the bone transforms that affect any of the vertices
	 * being drawn are loaded into the GL engine by this skin section prior to drawing the vertices.
	 * 
	 * Under OpenGL ES 1.1, the number of transform matrices that can be simultaneously loaded 
	 * into the GL engine matrix palette is limited by the platform, and that limit defines the
	 * maximum number of bones in the collection in this property. This platform limit can be
	 * retrieved from the CC3OpenGL.sharedGL.maxNumberOfPaletteMatrices property.
	 *
	 * The array returned by this property is created anew for each access. Do not add or remove
	 * bones from the returned array directly. To add a bone, use the addBone: method.

	 * will move and be deformed in tandem as the skeleton moves.
	 *
	 * If you are creating a chorus line of dancing characters, this may be the effect

	 *
	 * This method iterates through all the bones referenced by this skin section, and retrieves
	 * a bone with the same name from the structural descendants of the specified node.
	 *
	 * Typically, you would not invoke this method on the skin section directly. Instead, you
	 * would invoke a similar method on the CC3SkinMeshNode, or one of its structural ancestors.
