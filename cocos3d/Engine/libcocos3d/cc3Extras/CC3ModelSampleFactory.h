/**
 * CC3ModelSampleFactory is a convenience utility for creating sample 3D models for experimentation.
 * 
 * The design pattern is a singleton factory object, with methods for creating instances
 * of various 3D models. Access to the factory instance is through the factory class method.
 *
 * This class should be considered for testing and experimental use only. Unless you really
 * need teapots in your application, there is no need to include this class, or the teapot.h
 * data header file, in any finished application. Doing so will just bloat the size of the
 * application unnecessarily.
