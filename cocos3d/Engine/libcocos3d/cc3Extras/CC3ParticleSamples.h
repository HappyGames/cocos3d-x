/**
 * CC3HoseParticleNavigator confgures particles that support the CC3SprayParticleProtocol
 * to be emitted in a stream, as if from the nozzle of a hose.
 *
 * A CC3HoseParticleNavigator instance is made up of two parts: the navigator and the nozzle.
 * 
 * Particles live within the context of the emitter node, and movement of the emitter node affects
 * all of the particles already emitted by that emitter. For example, if the emitter is rotating,
 * the particles will rotate along with it as they live out their lives. The navigator is attached
 * to the emitter, and configures the life-span and trajectory of the particles.
 *
 * The location and rotation of the nozzle node determine where the particles will be emitted, and
 * in what direction, respectively. Moving the nozzle does not effect the movement of the particles
 * that have already been emitted.
 * 
 * By default, the nozzle node is a child node of the emitter. However, you can change the parent
 * node of the nozzle to some other object by invoking the addChild: method on the other node,
 * with the nozzle node as the argument.
 *
 * By assigning the nozzle to a different parent node, you can have the nozzle track another node,
 * and emit particles as that node travels. For example you might attach the nozzle to the tail of
 * a rocket node, to emit a trail of particles behind the rocket as the rocket moves.
 *
 * The parent of the nozzle (the rocket, for example) does not need to be a child or descendant of
 * this navigator's emitter. Like any node, the location and rotation properties of the nozzle are
 * specified relative to its parent (eg. the rocket).
 *
 * Note the difference in behaviour of the particles by having the nozzle move instead of the emitter.
 * In the rocket example, if the emitter was attached to the tail of the rocket, the emitted particles
 * would move along with the emitter, making it very difficult to calculate realistic paths for the
 * particles. By making the emitter stationary, and attaching only the nozzle to the rocket, the point
 * of emission moves with the rocket, but the particles move and live out their lives in fixed space,
 * and it becomes much simpler to calculate their movement.
 *
 * You can even combine the two frames of reference for interesting effects. You can put both the
 * emitter and the nozzle in separate motion. For example, to create clouds moving on a rotating globe,
 * you could place the emitter at the center of the globe, so that it and the cloud particles rotate
 * around with the globe, and have the nozzle also moving across the surface of the globe to simulate
 * the clouds travelling across the surface of the globe.
 * 
 * For such a complicated scenario to work, keep in mind that the emitter and the parent of the nozzle
 * should share a common ancestor node (in this example, the globe), to make it easy for the particles
 * to transition from the nozzle frame of reference to that of the emitter.
 *
 * You can set the shape of the nozzle using the dispersionAngle property, which specifies how tight or
 * wide the spray will be, and you can set a range of speeds for the particles as they leave the emitter.

	/**
	 * Indicates the angle of dispersion of the spray from the nozzle. This is specified as both a
	 * width and height, permitting the nozzle to have flexible shapes.
	 *
	 * During the emission of each particle, a random emission direction is chosen, within the angles
	 * specified by this property, relative to the forwardDirection of the nozzle node.
	 *
	 * The values are specified in degrees between zero and 180. The lower the angle, the tighter the stream.
	 *
	 * A different value can be specified for each of the width and height of the nozzle opening. Setting
	 * both width and height to small angles will create a tightly focused beam of particles. Setting both
	 * width and height to larger angles will result in particles emitted in a wide spray. Setting one or
	 * other of the width or height to a small angle and the other to a large angle will create a fan effect,
	 * where the particles are tightly constrained in one dimension, but spray widely in the other.
	 *
	 * The value of the shouldPrecalculateNozzleTangents property is affected by the setting of this
	 * property. When setting this property, if both components of the new value are less than 90 degrees,
	 * the value of the shouldPrecalculateNozzleTangents will automatically be set to YES, otherwise it
	 * will automatically be set to NO.
	 * 
	 * For small dispersion angles (< 90 degrees), it is possible to avoid two expensive tangent
	 * calculations every time a particle is emitted by precalculating the tangents of the dispersionAngle,
	 * and then randomizing on the value of the tangents instead of randomizing the value of the angle.
	 * For small angles, the effect is effectively the same. But for larger angles (approaching 180),
	 * randomizing the tangents has a very different effect than randomizing the emission angle. For this
	 * reason, tangent precalculation is automatically turned on for small angles (< 90 degrees) and off
	 * for larger angles. You can override this by setting the shouldPrecalculateNozzleTangents property
	 * directly, after you have set this dispersionAngle property.

	/**
	 * Indicates whether the emitter should precalculate tangent values for the dispersion angles, and
	 * then select a value from that range of tangents in order to determine a random direction for a particle.
	 *
	 * During the emission of each particle, a random emission direction is chosen within the angles
	 * specified by the dispersionAngle property. In order to convert the angles to direction, a tangent
	 * calculation must be made for each of the two random angles.
	 *
	 * For small dispersion angles (typically < 90 degrees), calculating the tangent once for each of the
	 * width and height of the dispersionAngle property, and then selecting a random value from the range
	 * of tangents provides equivalent randomization to selecting a random angle and then calculating its
	 * tangent. But in the first case, a tangent is only calculated once, for the dispersion angle itself,
	 * instead of each time a random angle is chosen.
	 *
	 * However, as the dispersion angle increases (approaching 180 degrees), the equivalent tangent
	 * grows exponentially, and the tangent range become ever larger, ending at infinity at 180 degrees.
	 * Therefore, as the dispersion angle increases, selecting a random value from the tangent range
	 * results in most angles clustering around the limits, resulting in very poor randomization.
	 *
	 * If this property is set to NO, whenever a particle is emitted, a random angle will be chosen within
	 * the range defined by the dispersionAngle property, for each of the width and height. Tangents are
	 * then calculated, and the particle direction set.
	 *
	 * If this property is set to YES, the dispersionAngle property will be converted into tangents, and
	 * whenever a particle is emitted, a random tangent value will be chosen within the range of tangents,
	 * and the particle direction will be set from that, without having to calculate a tangent from an
	 * angle for each particle.
	 *
	 * Typically, you will not need to set this property directly. The value of this property is set
	 * during the setting of dispersionAngle property. When setting the dispersionAngle property, if
	 * both components of the new value are less than 90 degrees, the value of this property will
	 * automatically be set to YES, otherwise it will automatically be set to NO.
	 *
	 * You can override this by setting this shouldPrecalculateNozzleTangents property directly,
	 * after you have set the dispersionAngle property.
	 *
	 * One interesting use-case for setting this property directly is to create a planar radial spray.
	 * You can accomplish this by setting the dispersionAngle property to {180, 180} and THEN setting
	 * this property to YES. Doing so will result in a hose that sprays particles in all directions in
	 * the X-Y plane, in a 2D radial particle effect. This happens because the tangents are effectively
	 * infinite for 180 degree sprays and so all of the particle are locked to the X-Y plane. You can then
	 * target this emitter at the camera, and the 2D effect will always remain perpendicular to the camera.
	 * This is a cheap way of creating a visual explosion effect without having to involve all three dimensions.
