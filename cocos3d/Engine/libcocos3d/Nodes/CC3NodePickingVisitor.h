/**
 * CC3NodePickingVisitor is a CC3NodeDrawingVisitor that is passed to a node when
 * it is visited during node picking operations using color-buffer based picking.
 *
 * The visit: method must be invoked with a CC3Scene instance as the argument.
 *
 * Node picking is the act of picking a 3D node from user input, such as a touch.
 * One method of accomplishing this is to draw the scene such that each object is
 * drawn in a unique solid color. Once the scene is drawn, the color of the pixel
 * that has been touched can be read from the OpenGL ES color buffer, and mapped
 * back to the object that was painted with that color.
