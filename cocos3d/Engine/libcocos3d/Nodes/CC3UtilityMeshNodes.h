 * that might be comprised of a number of smaller nodes with space in between them.
 *
 * If the parent node contains descendants that are moving around, the bounding box of the parent
 * node may be dynamic and constantly changing. If you want the touch box to track changes to the
 * parent bounding box, set the shouldAlwaysMeasureParentBoundingBox property to YES.
 *
 * You can also set the box property directly to create a box that is shaped differently than the

 * be larger than the actual visible nodes, in order to make it easier to touch.

 * faster or nicer rendering quality.
 *
 * Under OpenGL ES 1.1, fog is implemented as a direct feature of the GL engine, and this
 * class establishes the GL state for that fog.
 *
 * Under OpenGL versions that support GLSL, fog is rendered as a post-processing effect,
 * typically by rendering the scene to a surface that has both color and depth textures.
 * Add the color and depth textures from the scene-rendering surface to this node, and a
 * shader program that can render the node in clip-space, and provide fog effects. A good
 * choice is the combination of the CC3ClipSpaceTexturable.vsh vertex shader and the
 * CC3Fog.fsh fragment shader.
