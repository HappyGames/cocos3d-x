/**
 * CC3Camera represents the camera viewing the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3Camera is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the camera itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a camera can be mounted on a boom object or truck, and will move along with
 * the parent node. Or the camera node itself might have a light node attached as a child,
 * so that the light will move along with the camera, and point where the camera points.
 *
 * However, when adding a camera to an assembly of nodes, be aware of whether the parent nodes
 * use scaling. To construct the viewMatrix, the camera makes heavy use of matrix inversion of the
 * cummulative transform matrix of the camera's transforms and the transforms of all its ancestors.
 * If scaling has not been added to any ancestor nodes, the cummulative transform will be a Rigid
 * transform. Inverting a Rigid transform matrix is much, much faster (orders of magnitude) than
 * inverting a matrix that contains scaling and is therefore not rigid. If possible, try to avoid
 * applying scaling to the ancestor nodes of this camera.
 *
 * Like any CC3Node, CC3Camera can be pointed in a specific direction, pointed at a specific
 * location, or at a specific node by setting the forwardDirection, targetLocation, or target
 * properties, respectively.
 *
 * The camera can be configured for either perspective or parallel projection, using the
 * isUsingParallelProjection property. By default, the camera will use perspective projection.
 *
 * You can use the projectLocation: and projectNode: methods to project global locations within
 * the 3D scene into 2D view coordinates, indicating where on the screen a 3D object appears.
 *
 * You can use the unprojectPoint: and unprojectPoint:ontoPlane: methods to project a 2D screen
 * position into either a ray (a line) in the 3D scene, or into a specific intersection location
 * on a 3D plane.
 *
 * You can use the  moveToShowAllOf:... or moveWithDuration:toShowAllOf: family of methods to
 * have the camera automatically focus on, and display all of, a particular node, or even the
 * whole scene itself.
 *
 * Scaling a camera is a null operation because it scales everything, including the size of objects,
 * but also the distance from the camera to those objects. The effects cancel out, and visually it
 * appears that nothing has changed.
 *
 * Therefore, for cameras, the scale and uniformScale properties are not applied to the transform
 * matrix. Instead, the uniformScale property acts as a zoom factor (as if the camera lens is zoomed
 * in or out), and influences the fieldOfView property accordingly. See the description of the
 * fieldOfView property for more information about zooming.
 *
 * If you find that objects in the periphery of your view appear elongated, you can adjust
 * the fieldOfView and/or uniformScale properties to reduce this "fish-eye" effect.
 * See the notes of the fieldOfView property for more on this.
 *
 * For cameras, any change in the projection parameters, such as fieldOfView, scale, near or far
 * clipping distances, is considered a transform change, and the transformListeners are sent a
 * notification via the nodeWasTransformed: method when the projection matrix is recalculated.

	 * property is set to kCC3DefaultFieldOfView.
	 *
	 * The effect of setting this property is affected by the fieldOfViewOrientation,
	 * fieldOfViewAspectOrientation, and  uniformScale properties.
	 *
	 * In handheld devices, the device orientation can change at will, changing the aspect ratio
	 * of the camera viewport. The fieldOfViewOrientation, and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation
	 * properties work together to establish and maintain a consistent perspective, regardless
	 * of the current aspect ratio.
	 *
	 * The fieldOfViewOrientation property indicates whether this fieldOfView value is measured
	 * horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the display surface. 
	 *
	 * The fieldOfViewAspectOrientation property indicates the orientation (portrait or landscape)
	 * of the display surface to which this fieldOfView value is specified.
	 *
	 * The fieldOfViewOrientation and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation properties combine to
	 * determine whether the fieldOfView value is measured horizontally or vertically, and
	 * whether it was meant to be applied to the long or short side of the display surface.
	 * 
	 * Applying a field of view angle across the short side of the display surface will produce
	 * a somewhat different view perspective than if the same field of view value is applied
	 * across the long side of the display surface.
	 *
	 * Knowing these values, this camera can then automatically adjust the perspective, and keep
	 * it consistent, regardless of the actual orientation of the device and display surface.
	 *
	 * For example, if the fieldOfViewOrientation property indicates that the fieldOfView applies
	 * to the horizontal direction, and the fieldOfViewAspectOrientation indicates that the
	 * horizontal side is longer than the vertical side (landscape), the camera knows that the
	 * fieldOfView property should be applied to the long side, regardless of the orientation
	 * of the device and display surface. 
	 *
	 * As another example, a vertical fieldOfViewOrientation, combined with a landscape
	 * fieldOfViewAspectOrientation corresponds to the commonly-used Hor+ FOV technique.
	 *
	 * See the notes for the fieldOfViewOrientation and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation properties
	 * for more information about how they affect the use of the fieldOfView.
	 *
	 * The effective field of view is influenced by the value of the uniformScale property,
	 * which, for cameras, acts as a zoom factor (as if the camera lens is zoomed in or out).
	 * The effective field of view of this camera is calculated as (fieldOfView / uniformScale).
	 *
	 * Once a nominal field of view has been set in this property, changing the scale or
	 * uniformScale properties will change the effective field of view accordingly (although
	 * the value of the fieldOfView property remains the same). Scales greater than one zoom in
	 * (objects appear larger), and scales between one and zero zoom out (objects appear smaller).
	 *
	 * Like real-world cameras, larger values of the effective field of view can result in a
	 * "fish-eye" effect, where objects at the periphery of the view can appear elongated.
	 * To reduce this effect, lower the value of fieldOfView property, or increase the value
	 * of the uniformScale property. In doing so, you may need to move your camera further
	 * away from the scene, so that your view will continue to include the same objects.
	 *
	 * The effective field of view is clamped to keep it below 180 degrees, beyond which
	 * the scene would vanish into the distance.
