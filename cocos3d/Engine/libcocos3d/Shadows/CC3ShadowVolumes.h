/**
 * The mesh node used to build a shadow volume. A single CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode
 * instance represents the shadow from a single light for a single shadow-casting node.
 *
 * As a mesh node, the CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode instance is added as a child to the node
 * whose shadow is to be represented. To automatically create a CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode
 * and add it to the shadow-casting node, use the addShadowVolumesForLight: method on
 * the shadow-casting node (or any structural ancestor of that node).
 *
 * CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode implements the CC3ShadowProtocol. The implementation of the
 * updateShadow method populates a shadow volume mesh that encompasses the volume of
 * space shadowed by the shadow-casting node. Any other object with this shadow volume
 * will be shadowed by that node.
 *
 * The shadow volume mesh of this node is invisible in itself, but by depth-testing
 * against other drawn nodes, a stencil is created indicating which view pixels will
 * be in shadow. Those view pixels are then darkened accordingly.
 *
 * Of all shadowing techniques, shadow volumes result in the most accurate shadows,
 * but are also the most computationally intensive.
 *
 * Shadow volumes use a stencil buffer to determine the areas that require shading. The stencil
 * buffer must be allocated within the EAGLView when the view is created and initialized. Under
 * iOS, the sencil buffer is combined with the depth buffer, and you create a stencil buffer by
 * passing the value GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8 as the depth format argument in the CCGLView method
 * viewWithFrame:pixelFormat:depthFormat:preserveBackbuffer:sharegroup:multiSampling:numberOfSamples:.
