/**
 * CC3PointParticleEmitter emits particles that conform to the CC3PointParticleProtocol protocol.
 *
 * Each particle has its own location, and may optionally be configued with its own color
 * and individual size, and each particle may be configured with a vertex normal so that
 * it can interact with light sources. This particle content is defined by the
 * vertexContentTypes property of this emitter. 
 * 
 * Each point particle emitted displays the same texture, which is determined by the texture
 * property of this emitter node. Be aware that OpenGL point particles use the entire texture,
 * which you should generally ensure has dimensions that are power-of-two. Non-POT textures will
 * be padded by iOS when loaded, for compatibility with the graphics hardware. Although the
 * padding is generally transparent, it may throw off the expected location of your particle.
 *
 * In general, point particles will contain transparent content. As such, you will likely want
 * to set the blendFunc property to one of the following:
 *   - {GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA} - Standard realistic translucent blending
 *                                              (this is the initial setting).
 *   - {GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE} - Additive blending, to have overlapping particles build on,
 *                              and intensify, each other
 *
 * For CC3PointParticleEmitter, the initial value of the shouldDisableDepthMask property
 * is YES, so that the particles do not enage in Z-fighting with each other. You can
 * experiment with changing this to NO if your emitter is better suited to it.
 *
 * You can also experiment with the shouldDisableDepthTest and depthFunction properties
 * to see if change them helps you get the look you are trying to achieve.
 *
 * You can control characteristics about the sizes of the particles, and how that size should
 * change with distance from the camera, using the particleSize, particleSizeMinimum,
 * particleSizeMaximum, particleSizeAttenuation, and unityScaleDistance properties.
 *
 * All memory used by the particles and the underlying vertex mesh is managed by the
 * emitter node, and is deallocated automatically when the emitter is released.
