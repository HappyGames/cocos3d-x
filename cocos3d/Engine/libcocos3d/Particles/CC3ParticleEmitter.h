/**
 * A CC3MeshNode that emits 3D particles.
 *
 * Particles are small, simple objects that can each have their own location, movement,
 * color, and lifetime. They are used where many simple and similar objects are needed.
 * Examples might include confetti, stars, tiles, bricks, etc.
 *
 * One key way that particles differ from mesh nodes is that all vertices for all of the particles
 * managed by an emitter are submitted to the GL engine in a single draw call. This is much more
 * efficient than each mesh making its own GL call, and for large numbers of small objects, this
 * technique dramatically improves performance.
 *
 * Particles can be added to an emitter directly, using the emitParticle: method, can be created
 * and emitted from the emitter manually, using the emitParticle and emitParticles: method, or
 * can be emitted automatically at a pre-determined rate from the emitter by setting the emission
 * properties of the emitter.
 
 * Typically, particles are automatically created and emitted by the emitter at some predetermined
 * rate and pattern, such as a fountain, fire, hose, etc. and follow a pre-determined algorithmic
 * path with a finite life span.
 *
 * Alternately, particles can be added to the emitter by the application directly, with the emitter
 * containing and managing the particles, but leaving the application in control of particle control
 * and interaction. In this use case, the emitter acts as a mesh batching system, allowing the meshes
 * from a large number of distinct objects to be submitted to the GL engine in a single draw call.
 * For example, the application may want to create a large number of bricks, tiles, plants, etc.,
 * and have them efficiently managed and rendered by an emitter.
 *
 * All particles added to or emitted by this emitter will be covered by the same material, and optional
 * texture, as determined by the material and texture properties of this emitter node. But each particle
 * may have its own location, movement, orientation, normals, and colors.
 *
 * Although all particles are covered by the same material and texture, if the vertexContentTypes
 * property of this emitter is configured with the kCC3VertexContentColor component, then each
 * particle can be assigned a different color. And for particles that support texture mapping,
 * such as mesh particles, then each particle can be covered by a different section of the
 * texture assigned to the emitter, effectivly allowing each particle to be textured differently.
 *
 * Particles managed by a CC3ParticleEmitter live in the 3D scene, as distinct from the 2D
 * particles available through the Cocos2D CCParticleSystem class.
 * 
 * For many particle effects, 2D is sufficient, and can be quite effective. You can use a Cocos2D
 * CCParticleSystem instance with a CC3Billboard, to embed 2D particle systems within a 3D Cocos3D scene.
 *
 * However, for applications that need particles to move in three dimensions, you can use this class,
 * or one of its specialized subclasses. Each particle emitted by this emitter has a 3D location,
 * and can appear in front of or behind other 3D objects, depending on relative distance from the camera.
 *
 * A particle system embodies three classes working together to emit and control particles.
 *   -# The emitter is responsible for generating and managing particles of a particular type.
 *      Particles that have expired can be reused, reinitialized and re-emitted by the emitter.
 *      Typically, you will use one of the standard emitters.
 *   -# The navigator is attached to the emitter and configures the lifetime and path of the
 *      particle. You can use one of the standard navigators, but you will often write your
 *      own navigator to provide more interesting emission characterstics and finer control
 *      of how each particle is configured.
 *   -# The particle itself is responsible for executing the behaviour and motion of the particle
 *      throughout its lifespan. You will generally always write your own particle subclass.
 *
 * When a particle is added or emitted, all three of these objects get a chance to initialize
 * and configure the particle. Typically, the emitter is responsible for instanitating a new
 * particle, or arranging to reuse an expired particle. The navigator initializes the lifetime
 * and path configuration information within the particle, or the particle itself can do so
 * during its own initialization. During this process, the emitter invokes the initializeParticle:
 * method on itself and the navigator, and then the initializeParticle method on the particle.
 *
 * The isAlive property is automatically set to YES before the initializeParticle method is
 * invoked on the particle, so you don't have to set it there. You can, however, set it to
 * NO during execution of the initializeParticle method, to abort the emission of that particle.
 *
 * Subsequently, on each update pass, the emitter will automatically invoke the updateBeforeTransform:
 * method (and optionally the updateAfterTransform: method) on the particle. You will override this
 * method to define the behaviour of your particles over time. If your particles have a finite lifespan,
 * you can indicate that a particle has expired by having the particle set its own isAlive property
 * to NO within the updateBeforeTransform: (or updateAfterTransform:) method. The emitte will then
 * arrange to remove the particle and set it aside for future reuse.
 *
 * To enhance performance and memory, particles that have expired are retained and reused as further
 * particles are emitted. This is transparent to the particles (and the developer), as the reused
 * particle follow the same initialize/update life-cycle described above. The isAlive property is
 * reset to YES, and the initializeParticle: methods of the emitter and navigator, and the
 * initializeParticle method of the particle are invoked when the particle is reused and emitted again.
 *
 * Like all mesh nodes, the emitter contains a CC3Material instance that determines how the particle
 * content will blend with content from other 3D objects that overlap this emitter, and to specify
 * the texture that covers the particles.
 *
 * You can indicate the rate at which particle are emitted by setting either of the emissionRate
 * or emissionInterval properties. You can set for how long the emitter should emit particles
 * using the emissionDuration property.
 *
 * For emitters with finite emissionDuration, you can set the shouldRemoveOnFinish to YES to
 * indicate that the emitter should remove itself automatically from the 3D scene, once all
 * particles have expired, cleaning up all memory usage by the emitter and particles along the
 * way. This features allows you to set a transient particle generator, such as an explosion,
 * going and then forget about it.
 *
 * By default, the boundingVolume of the emitter will automatically be recalculated every time
 * a particle moves. Although this is convenient and ensures accuracy, recalculating the bounding
 * volume can often be an expensive operation. To avoid this, you can manually set static boundaries
 * in the boundingVolume of this emitter node and then set the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume property
 * of this emitter to YES to indicate that you don't want the emitter to recalculate its
 * boundingVolume on each update.
 *
 * During development, you can verify the size of this static bounding volume your settings by
 * setting the shouldDrawBoundingVolume property to YES to make the bounding volume visible to
 * ensure that the bounding volume is sized appropriately to contain all the particles, without
 * being overly expansive.
 *
 * You may be wondering how to determine the correct static bounding volume properties. You can do
 * this at development time by setting the shouldMaximize property of the boundingVolume of this
 * emitter to YES, and setting the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume property of this emitter to NO, so
 * that the boundingVolume will be recalculated on each update. After the emitter has finished,
 * output the boundingVolume to the log using LogDebug to record the maximume size that the bounding
 * volume grew to during particle emission. This will give you an idea of how big to set the static
 * boundary properties of the boundingVolume of your emitter.
 *
 * All memory used by the particles and the underlying vertex mesh is managed by this
 * emitter node, and is deallocated automatically when the emitter is released.
