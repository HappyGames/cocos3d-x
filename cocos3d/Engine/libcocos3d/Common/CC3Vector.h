/** 
 * A vector in 3D space. 
 *
 * Although CC3Vector has the same internal structure as GLKVector3, the structures may 
 * have different byte alignment requirements. Avoid casting directly between GLKVector3 
 * and CC3Vector, as this is not guaranteed to work reliably. Instead, use the functions
 * CC3VectorFromGLKVector3 and GLKVector3FromCC3Vector to convert between the two structures.
 *
 * You can, however, reliably copy an array of GLKVector3s to an array of CC3Vectors, and 
 * vice-versa, by simply using memcpy, or equivalent memory copying function. This is also 
 * true of single CC3Vector and GLKVector3 structures. Copying is successful because the 
 * array or pointer declarations will ensure the respective byte-alignment requirements, and
 * since the internal structures are identical, the contents of the copy will be identical.
