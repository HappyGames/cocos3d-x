	/**
	 * Create shader instance compiled from GLSL source code identified by the specified PFX shader
	 * specification in the specified PFX resource loader.
	 *
	 * Shaders loaded through this method are cached. If the shader was already loaded and is in
	 * the cache, it is retrieved and returned. If the shader has not in the cache, it is created
	 * compiled from GLSL code identified by the specified PFX shader specification, and added to
	 * the shader cache. It is safe to invoke this method any time the shader is needed, without
	 * having to worry that the shader will be repeatedly loaded and compiled.
	 *
	 * If the shader is created and compiled, the GLSL code may be embedded in the PFX file, or
	 * may be contained in a separate GLSL source code file, as defined by the PFX shader spec.
	 *
	 * To clear a shader instance from the cache, use the removeShader: method.
